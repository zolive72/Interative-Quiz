# Interative-Quiz
My first quiz
In this project, I use for the first time the bootstrap framework that professor Roger Melo (CJRM) introduced to me. 
I didn't know it but it was a good experience for me and a challenge because I had to discover it, by reading severals informations
on the page https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/.

This quiz works with HTML, Bootstrap CSS and javascript code allowing to check the answers of the users.
